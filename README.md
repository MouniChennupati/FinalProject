# FinalProject
Website name : LittleH Truecakes

Abstract: 
I always have an idea of having a website for our family bakery. I took up this chance of having one for it by implementing the knowledge I gained through the course. This would help us in a much better way for the business. This must be our official website to be launched soon.

Description: 
This is a Bakery website, wherein we can purchase the customised and fresh cakes besides desserts and sweets. The items, we chose will be added to the cart and after all the items we want to purchase are added to the cart, we can proceed to the payment.

Features:
1) We can see the outlet of LittleH Bakery and the images of items. You can meet our chefs, to get to know of their experience. 
2) Customer can customise the cakes in website.
3) You can see the exact image of the item when you are adding the item.
4) Customer come across the location of the outlet.
5) Get to see the services of the bakery like Hours of operation, Contact and delivery.

Future Improvements:
1) Need to make more options to choose.
2) Some features like Location is not directing the customer to the Maps application.
3) The cart should direct the customer to payment page.
4) Make this the official website for our bakery by creating a link that is easily accessible.

Expected Result:
To make this the official website by making the necessary improvements. The expected result is not completely obtained.

Issues with site:
1) Cart page is not directing it to the payment page. 
2) Signin button is working only when the code is newly run. It is not getting signed in the second time after running the code. I faced this a few times.
